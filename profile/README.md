# Ovomaltino 

All three repositories in this Github organization was developed to the first implementation of a multi-agent system model capable of evolving through sociological concepts and the exposure to an external, unknown and uncontrolled system without the need for a training, standard or previously established objective. 

It was called Ovaltino in honor of a friend who died but who was always by my side on my journey
